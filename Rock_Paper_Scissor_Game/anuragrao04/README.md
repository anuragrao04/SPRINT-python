# Issue #8 Rock Paper Scissor 
## Details 
Name: Anurag Rao

Github username: anuragrao04

Implemented a rock paper scissor game using the random library. It generated a random number between 1 and 3 (1 and 3 included) and those numbers correspond to Rock Paper and Scissor. 

1 -> Rock

2 -> Paper

3 -> Scissor 

I implemented an infinite loop to make the game feel more natural. I hope you enjoy it!
