# Issue #9 Text To Speech Converter
## Details 
Name: Anurag Rao

Github username: anuragrao04

pyttsx3 threw an error which I could not fix. I used gtts instead. gtts converts the text to a .mp3 file and then used ```playsound``` to play the .mp3 file.

## Library Used:
```gtts```

```pip install gtts```

```playsound```

```pip install playsound```
